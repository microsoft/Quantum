# Qubit Measurements #

This example demonstrates the use of measurement operations to convert the state of one or more qubits into classical bits that can be used in the classical control code.

## Running the Example ##

Open the `QsharpLibraries.sln` solution in Visual Studio and set `Samples/Measurement/Measurement.csproj` as the startup project.
Press Start in Visual Studio to run the example.

## Manifest ##

- [Measurement.qs](./Measurement.qs): Q# code preparing and measuring a few qubits.
- [Driver.cs](./Driver.cs): C# code to call the operations defined in Q#.
- [Measurement.csproj](./Measurement.csproj): Main C# project for the example.
