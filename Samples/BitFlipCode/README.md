# Bit-flip Quantum Code Sample #

This sample describes a simple quantum code that encodes 1 qubit into 3 qubits and protects against a single bit-flip error. 

## Running the Sample ##

Open the `QsharpLibraries.sln` solution in Visual Studio and set the .csproj file in the manifest as the startup project.
Press Start in Visual Studio to run the sample.

## Manifest ##

- [BitFlipCode.qs](./BitFlipCode.qs): Q# code implementing quantum operations for this sample.
- [Driver.cs](./Driver.cs): C# code to interact with and print out results of the Q# operations for this sample.
- [BitFlipCode.csproj](./BitFlipCode.csproj): Main C# project for the sample.
