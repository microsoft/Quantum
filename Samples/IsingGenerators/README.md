# Ising Generators Sample #

This sample describes how Hamiltonians may be represented using library functions. The Ising model is decomposed into single-site and two-site terms which are added. A simple extension to the Heisenberg model is also illustrated.

## Running the Sample ##

Open the `QsharpLibraries.sln` solution in Visual Studio and set the .csproj file in the manifest as the startup project.
Press Start in Visual Studio to run the sample.
