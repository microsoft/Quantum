# VQE in Q#

## Christopher Kang (main VQE code) || Rob Minneker (ansatz preparation + classical update)

This code is a sample for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). The VQE is an algorithm that allows for simulations similar to Trotterization and Qubitization, without the deep circuits needed for those algorithms. We've started our sample on H2O, but feel free to try it on the other YAML files provided! 

This code is part of a final project for the 490Q class. Julian Roth is also on our team - he authored awesome code for a PSI4 to Broombridge format conversion! Check it out ;)

With much love from Seattle,
Chris, Rob, & Julian
