# Intro to Q# and Jupyter Notebook

This sample demonstrates:
- How to use Jupyter Notebook as a host program to run Q# applications.

## Prerequisites

- The Microsoft [Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/install-guide/).
- Jupyter Notebook

## Running the Sample

From the command line, start Jupyter Notebook and open the [Notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/microsoft/Quantum/blob/master/samples/getting-started/intro-to-iqsharp/Notebook.ipynb) file.

```
jupyter notebook Notebook.ipynb
```

## Manifest

- [Notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/microsoft/Quantum/blob/master/samples/getting-started/intro-to-iqsharp/Notebook.ipynb): a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to simulate Q# operations and functions.
- [Operations.qs](https://github.com/microsoft/Quantum/blob/master/samples/getting-started/intro-to-iqsharp/Operations.qs): Q# code called from the Jupyter Notebook for this sample.
