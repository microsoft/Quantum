# Contributing to the Quantum Development Kit Samples #

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to the Quantum Development Kit!

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.
For more details on how to contribute to the samples or to the rest of the Quantum Development Kit, please see the [contribution guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/contributing-overview/).

## Asking Questions

Have a question? The `q#` tags on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/q%23) and [Quantum Computing StackExchange](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/q%23) are great places to ask questions about Q#, Quantum Development Kit and quantum computing in general.
You can learn more about our work on the [Q# Development Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/qsharp/) and ask questions in the comments as well.
However you ask it, your well-worded question will serve as a resource to others searching for help.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in the Quantum Development Kit?
Have a feature request?
We want to hear about it!
Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Identify Where to Report

The Quantum Development Kit is distributed across multiple repositories. Try to file the issue against the correct repository.
Check the list [in the contribution guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/contributing-overview#where-do-contributions-go) if you aren't sure which repo is correct.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request.
Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

* Which sample or samples are affected

* Component versions
    - .NET Core SDK version
    - Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code extension version (if applicable)
    - Python version (if applicable)
    - Version of the `qsharp` package for Python (if applicable)
    - IQ# version as reported by `dotnet iqsharp --version` (if applicable)

* Your operating system

* Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue

* What you expected to happen, versus what actually happened

## Contributing Documentation

If you are interested in contributing to conceptual documentation about the Quantum Development Kit, please see the [MicrosoftDocs/quantum-docs-pr](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/quantum-docs-pr) repository.
If you are interested in contributing to API references, please see [Contributing to the API References](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/contributing-docs#contributing-to-the-api-references) in the contribution guide.

## Contributing Fixes and New Features

If you are interested in writing code to fix issues, to implement new features in existing samples, or even to contribute entirely new samples, please see [Contributing Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/contributing-code) in the contribution guide.
