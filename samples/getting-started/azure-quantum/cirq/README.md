# Getting started submitting quantum circuits with Cirq

These sample notebooks demonstrate how to use the `azure-quantum` Python library to submit quantum circuits expressed with [Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq) to an Azure Quantum Workspace.

## Installation

To install the optional dependencies for the "Getting started with Cirq" notebooks, run

```shell
pip install azure-quantum[cirq]
```

### Running the Sample

Once everything is installed, run `jupyter notebook` to start the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser:

```shell
jupyter notebook
```

In the browser, select the desired sample notebook to view the code.
