# Getting Started with Quantum Development #

- **[Measurement](./measurement/)**:
  This sample goes into more detail about how single- and multiple-qubit measurements are represented in Q#, and how to measure in interesting bases such as the Bell basis.
- **[Teleportation](./teleportation/)**:
  This sample documents how to write quantum programs with Q#, C#, and Visual Studio, using the [development techniques](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/user-guide) covered in the main documentation.
  It also shows how to simulate the same algorithms from Python and Jupyter.
- **[Simple Algorithms](./simple-algorithms/)**:
  This sample covers several different basic quantum algorithms, and how each can be written in Q#.
- **[Intro to IQ#](./intro-to-iqsharp/)**:
  This samples explains how to create interactive notebooks using Jupyter and IQ#.
