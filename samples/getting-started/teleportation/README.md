# Quantum Teleportation Sample

This sample demonstrates the use of the Quantum Development Kit for quantum teleportation, a sort of "hello, world" for quantum programming.

## Prerequisites ##

- The Microsoft [Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/install-overview-qdk/).

## Running the Sample

To run the sample, use the `dotnet run` command from your terminal. 

## Manifest ##

- [TeleportationSample.qs](https://github.com/microsoft/Quantum/blob/main/samples/getting-started/teleportation/TeleportationSample.qs): Q# code defining how to teleport qubit states.
- [Utils.qs](https://github.com/microsoft/Quantum/blob/main/samples/getting-started/teleportation/Utils.qs): Q# code with some utility operations used to prepare and read |+> and |-> states.
- [Program.qs](https://github.com/microsoft/Quantum/blob/main/samples/getting-started/teleportation/Program.qs): Q# entry point to interact with and print out results of the Q# operations for this sample.
- [TeleportationSample.csproj](https://github.com/microsoft/Quantum/blob/main/samples/getting-started/teleportation/TeleportationSample.csproj): Main Q# project for the example.
