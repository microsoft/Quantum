# Measuring Qubits

This sample demonstrates:
- The use of measurement operations to measure one or more qubits, getting classical data back that can be used in classical logic.
- How to use assertions to build tests for expected behaviour of operations that involve measurements.
- Resetting previously allocated qubits.

In Q#, the most basic measurement operation is the [`M`](https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.intrinsic.m) operation, which measures a single qubit in the _computational basis_ (sometimes also called the ùëç-basis).
In this sample, we show how `M` can be used to sample random numbers, and to measure registers of qubits.

## Prerequisites

- The Microsoft [Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/install-overview-qdk/).

## Running the Sample

To run the sample, use the `dotnet run` command from your terminal.
