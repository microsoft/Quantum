# Hubbard Simulation Sample

This sample walks through constructing the Jordan–Wigner representation of the time-evolution operator for the 1D Hubbard simulation model, similarly to the [**HubbardHamiltonian**](../../simulation/hubbard/) sample, but using the chemistry library to represent the Hubbard model.

## Manifest

- [Program.cs](./Program.cs): C# program that constructs a fermionic Hamiltonian for the 1D Hubbard model.
- [CreateHubbardHamiltonian.csproj](./CreateHubbardHamiltonian.csproj): Main C# project for the sample.
