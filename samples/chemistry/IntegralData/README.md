# Integral Data for Chemistry Hamiltonians #

This contains integral data describing a variety of chemistry Hamiltonians.

## Data sources

- **[Liquid](./Liquid/)**:
    Orbital integrals generated by Microsoft. These are loaded by the 'FermionHamiltonian.LoadFromLiquid' method.

- **[YAML](./YAML/)**:
    Orbital integrals generated by NWChem yaml branch. These are loaded by the [`FermionHamiltonian.LoadFromYAML`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.quantum.chemistry.fermionhamiltonian.loadfromyaml) method. 
    There is a README.md file describing the relevance of the provided integral data files from the chemistry point of view.
