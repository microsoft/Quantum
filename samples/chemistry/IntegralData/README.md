# Integral Data for Chemistry Hamiltonians #

This contains integral data describing a variety of chemistry Hamiltonians. 

## Data sources

- **[Liquid](./Liquid/)**:
    Orbital integrals generated by Microsoft. These are loaded by the 'FermionHamiltonian.LoadFromLiquid' method.

- **[YAML](./YAML/)**:
    Orbital integrals generated by NWChem yaml branch. These are loaded by the [`BroombridgeSerializer.Deserialize`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.quantum.chemistry.broombridge.broombridgeserializer.deserialize) method. 
    There is a README.md file describing the relevance of the provided integral data files from the chemistry point of view.
