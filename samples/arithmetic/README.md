# Adder Sample #

This sample shows how to add two integers using the arithmetic functionality in the Q# canon.
Two examples of adders implemented in this sample are that of [Takahashi *et al.*](https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2530) and [Cuccaro *et al.*](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0410184).

## Running the Sample ##

To run this sample, you will need Jupyter Notebook and the IQ# kernel.
For instructions on how to set up these tools see the [getting started guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/install-overview-qdk/).
To start the Jupyter Notebook use the following command in this directory.
```
PS> jupyter notebook AdderExample.ipynb
```
Use the `Run` button to walk through the notebook line by line.
