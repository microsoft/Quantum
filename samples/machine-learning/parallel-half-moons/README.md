# Training sequential models with Q#, using multiple simulators in parallel

This sample uses Q# and the Microsoft.Quantum.MachineLearning library to train a simple sequential model.
The model is trained on a half-moons dataset, loaded in C# using the System.Text.Json package, then preprocessed using Q#.

In this sample, the training loop is parallelized over model start points, with each model using its own instance of the full-state quantum simulator.
Parallelizing in this way can lead to significantly improved performance, especially when using a large number of cores on a small number of qubits.
The actual distribution of parallel tasks is performed using [Parallel LINQ (PLINQ)](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/parallel-linq-plinq) from a C# host.

## Prerequisites

- The Microsoft [Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/install-overview-qdk/).

## Running the Sample

This sample can be run in a number of different ways, depending on your preferred environment.
