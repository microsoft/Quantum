# Training sequential models with Q#, using built-in datasets

This sample uses Q# and the Microsoft.Quantum.MachineLearning library to train a simple sequential model.
The model is trained on the [wine dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine) from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/), using a classifier structure defined in Q#.

## Prerequisites

- The Microsoft [Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/install-overview-qdk/).

## Running the Sample

This sample can be run in a number of different ways, depending on your preferred environment.

### Python in Visual Studio Code or the Command Line

At a terminal, run the following command:

```powershell
python host.py
```

### C# in Visual Studio Code or the Command Line

At a terminal, run the following command:

```powershell
dotnet run
```

### C# in Visual Studio 2019

Open the folder containing this sample in Visual Studio ("Open a local folder" from the Getting Started screen or "File → Open → Folder..." from the menu bar) and set `Wine.csproj` as the startup project.
Press Start in Visual Studio to run the sample.
