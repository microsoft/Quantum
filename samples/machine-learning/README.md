# Machine Learning Samples

- **[Half Moons](./half-moons)**
This sample implements using the quantum machine learning library to train a sequential model on the half-moons dataset.

- **[Parallel Half Moons](./parallel-half-moons)**
This sample implements using the quantum machine learning library to train a sequential model on the half-moons dataset, parallelizing over target machines
