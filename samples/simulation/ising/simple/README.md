# Ising Simple Sample #

This sample walks through constructing the time-evolution operator for the Ising model manually.
This time-evolution operator is applied to adiabatically prepare the ground state of the Ising model.
The net magnetization is then measured.

## Running the Sample

To run the sample, use the `dotnet run` command from your terminal.
