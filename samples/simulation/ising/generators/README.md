# Ising Generators Sample

This sample describes how Hamiltonians may be represented using library functions. The Ising model is decomposed into single-site and two-site terms which are added. A simple extension to the Heisenberg model is also illustrated.

## Running the Sample

### In Visual Studio Code or the Command Line

At a terminal, run the following command:

```dotnetcli
dotnet run
```

### In Visual Studio 2019

Open the `simulation.sln` solution in Visual Studio and set the .csproj file in the manifest as the startup project.
Press Start in Visual Studio to run the sample.

## Manifest

- [IsingGenerators.qs](./IsingGenerators.qs): Q# code implementing quantum operations for this sample.
- [Program.cs](./Program.cs): C# code to interact with and print out results of the Q# operations for this sample.
- [IsingGeneratorsSample.csproj](./IsingGeneratorsSample.csproj): Main C# project for the sample.
