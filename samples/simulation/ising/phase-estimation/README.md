# Ising Phase Estimation Sample #

This sample adiabatically prepares the ground state of the Ising model Hamiltonian,
and then perform phase estimation to obtain an estimate of the ground state energy.

## Running the Sample ##

Open the `QsharpSamples.sln` solution in Visual Studio and set the .csproj file in the manifest as the startup project.
Press Start in Visual Studio to run the sample.

## Manifest ##

- [IsingPhaseEstimation.qs](./IsingPhaseEstimation.qs): Q# code implementing quantum operations for this sample.
- [Program.cs](./Program.cs): C# code to interact with and print out results of the Q# operations for this sample.
