# Ising Trotter Sample

This sample walks through constructing the time-evolution operator for the Ising model using the Trotterization library feature. This time-evolution operator is applied to investigate spin relaxation.

## Running the Sample

Open the `QsharpSamples.sln` solution in Visual Studio and set the .csproj file in the manifest as the startup project.
Press Start in Visual Studio to run the sample.

## Manifest
