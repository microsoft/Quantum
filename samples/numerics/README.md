# Numerics library samples

The samples in this folder show how to use the numerics library.
The `CustomModAdd` sample illustrates how to implement a custom modular addition operation.
The `EvaluatingFunctions` sample shows how to evaluate smooth functions using a polynomial
approximation in fixed-point arithmetic and `ResourceCounting` counts the resources of this
operation.

## Running the Samples

Choose the sample to run and navigate to the corresponding folder.
To run, e.g., `EvaluatingFunctions`, enter the directory using

```bash
cd Numerics/EvaluatingFunctions
```

and then run the project:

```dotnetcli
dotnet run
```
