- **[Custom Mod Add](./custom-mod-add/)**:
  This sample illustrates how to implement a custom modular addition operation.
- **[Evaluating Functions](./evaluating-functions/)**:
  This sample shows how to evaluate smooth functions using a polynomial approximation in fixed-point arithmetic.
- **[Resource Counting](./resource-counting/)**:
  This sample counts the resources used by `Evaluating Functions`.

## Running the Samples

Choose the sample to run and navigate to the corresponding folder.
To run, e.g., `EvaluatingFunctions`, enter the directory using
