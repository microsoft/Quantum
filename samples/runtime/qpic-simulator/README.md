# Generating quantum circuit diagrams from execution traces

This sample illustrates how `IQuantumProcessor` can be used to generate quantum
circuit diagrams from Q# program execution traces, using the [⟨q|pic⟩
language](https://github.com/qpic/qpic).  It makes uses of custom intrinsic
operations and classical control transformations.

## Prerequisites

- The Microsoft [Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/install-overview-qdk/)
- [⟨q|pic⟩](https://github.com/qpic/qpic)

## Running the Sample

This sample can be run in a number of different ways, depending on your
preferred environment.

### C# in Visual Studio Code or the Command Line

At a terminal, run the following command (with example arguments for the inputs) in the `host` directory:

```dotnetcli
dotnet test
```

After running the tests, the directory `bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1` contains ⟨q|pic⟩
circuit diagrams for the test cases.  You can create picture files from them
using the following commands (assuming that ⟨q|pic⟩ is installed):

```shell
cp bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/t-injection.qpic .
qpic -f png t-injection.qpic
```

The resulting file will look as follows:

![T injection circuit diagram](t-injection.png)

### C# in Visual Studio 2019

Open the folder containing this sample in Visual Studio ("Open a local folder"
from the Getting Started screen or "File → Open → Folder..." from the menu bar)
and set `host/host.csproj` as the startup project. Press Start in
Visual Studio to run the sample.
