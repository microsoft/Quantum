# Runtime Samples

These samples show how to work with the Q# simulation runtime.

- **[Oracle Emulation](./oracle-emulation)**:
  This sample shows how to provide accelerated simulation functionality for different Q# operations and functions.
- **[Reversible simulator (simple)](./reversible-simulator-simple)**:
  This sample demonstrates the basic use of the `IQuantumProcessor` interface to build a simple reversible simulator.
- **[Reversible simulator (advanced)](./reversible-simulator-advanced)**:
  This sample extends the simple reversible simulator with advanced use cases.
- **[Qpic simulator](./qpic-simulator)**:
  This sample uses `IQuantumProcessor` to generate quantum circuit diagrams from execution traces.
- **[Simulator with Overrides](./simulator-with-overrides)**:
  This sample shows how to create a quantum simulator which relies on a full state quantum simulator and redefines some of the built-in operations.
- **[State Visualizer](./state-visualizer)**:
  This sample demonstrates how to integrate the Quantum Development Kit with web development technologies to provide interactive visualizations.
