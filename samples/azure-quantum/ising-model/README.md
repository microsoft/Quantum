# Simulating the Ising model on quantum hardware with the Trotter–Suzuki decomposition

This sample demonstrates how to use Q# and the Azure Quantum service together to simulate evolution under the [transverse Ising model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse-field_Ising_model) by using the Trotter–Suzuki decomposition.

This sample is implemented as a _standalone executable_, such that no C# or Python host is needed.

## Running the sample on a local simulator

```dotnetcli
dotnet run -- --simulator QuantumSimulator --n-sites=5 --time=5.0 --dt=0.1
```

## Running the sample on the Azure Quantum service

Make sure that you have [created and selected a quantum workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/how-to-create-quantum-workspaces-with-the-azure-portal), and then run the following at the command line, substituting `TARGET` with the target that you would like to run against (e.g.: `ionq.qpu` or `honeywell.hqs-lt-1.0`):

```azcli
az quantum execute --target-id TARGET -- --n-sites=5 --time=5.0 --dt=0.1
```

For a full list of available QIO and quantum computing targets, run:

```azcli
az quantum target list --output table
```
