# Solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems using QAOA on Azure Quantum

This sample shows how to solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on the Azure Quantum service. It demonstrates how to operate the QAOA workflow with a readily available problem instance (Maximum Cut) as well as a general QUBO problem that can be taylored to other combinatorial problems like graph coloring or minimum vertex cover.
