# Quantum teleportation sample

This sample demonstrates how to use Q# and the Azure Quantum service together to teleport quantum data within a device.

This sample is implemented as a _standalone executable_, such that no C# or Python host is needed.

## Running the sample on a local simulator

```dotnetcli
dotnet run -- --simulator QuantumSimulator --prep-basis PauliX --meas-basis PauliX
```

## Running the sample on the Azure Quantum service

Make sure that you have [created and selected a quantum workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/how-to-create-quantum-workspaces-with-the-azure-portal), and then run the following at the command line, substituting `TARGET` with the target that you would like to run against (e.g.: `quantinuum.qpu.h1`).

```azcli
az quantum execute --target-id TARGET -- --prep-basis PauliX --meas-basis PauliX
```

> **⚠ NOTE:** In order to run this sample, the target must support comparing measurement results.

For a full list of available quantum computing targets, run:

```azcli
az quantum target list --output table
```
