    "The Ising model is a mathematical model of ferromagnetism in a lattice (in our case a 2D square lattice) with two kinds of terms in the Hamiltonian: (i) an interaction term between adjacent sites and (ii) an external magnetic field acting at each site. For our purposes, we consider a simplified version of the model where the interaction terms have the same strength and the external field strength is the same at each site.\n",

    "where $J$ is the interaction strength, $g$ is external field strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time evolution $e^{-iHt}$ for the Hamiltonian is simulated with the fourth-order product formula so that any errors in simulation are sufficiently small. Essentially, this is done by simulating the evolution for small slices of time $\\Delta$ and repeating this for `nSteps` $= t/\\Delta$ to obtain the full time evolution. The Trotter-Suzuki formula for higher orders can be recursively defined using a *fractal decomposition* as discussed in Section 3 of [[Hatanao and Suziki's survey](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11526216_2)]. Then the fourth order formula $U_4(\\Delta)$ can be constructed using the second-order one $U_2(\\Delta)$ as follows.\n",
