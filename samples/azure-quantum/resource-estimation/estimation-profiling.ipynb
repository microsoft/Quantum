    "\n",
    "In [_A logarithmic-depth quantum carry-lookahead adder_](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406142), the authors present an out-of-place quantum adder implementation based on the [classical carry-lookahead adder method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry-lookahead_adder).  To briefly summarize, the idea of carry-lookahead adder is to compute all carry bits $c_i$ based on propagate bits $p_i = x_i \\oplus y_i$ and generate bits $g_i = x_i \\land y_i$, without requiring other carry bits except for the carry-in $c_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the first carry bit can be computed as $c_1 = g_0 \\oplus (p_0 \\land c_0)$, since either it is generated from bits $x_0$ and $y_0$ (when both are 1, and therefore $g_0 = 1$) or the carry bit $c_0$ is propagated (if either $x_0$ or $y_0$ is 1, and therefore $p_0 = 1$).  More significant carry bits are computed in a similar way, for example $c_3 = g_2 \\oplus (g_1 \\land p_2) \\oplus (g_0 \\land p_1 \\land p_2) \\oplus (c_0 \\land p_0 \\land p_1 \\land p_2)$.  That is, $c_3$ is either generated from bits at index 2, or generated from bits at index 1 _and_ propagated from bits at index 2, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to minimize AND gates, these intermediate products can be computed in a clever way, as well as in logarithmic depth.  We are now looking at an implementation of the carry-lookahead adder in Q#, and start by implementing a helper function to compute the number of 1-bits an an integer, also called Hamming weight, using a compact implementation based on a sequence of bitwise manipulations (you can learn more about these constants and why it works [on this article in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight#Efficient_implementation))."
