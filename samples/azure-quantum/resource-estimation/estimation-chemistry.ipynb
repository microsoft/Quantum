VQE algorithms are useful for building an understanding of the current limits of quantum hardware for the purposes of education and research. In the longer term, we will simulate quantum systems using more efficient algorithms tailored for large-scale fault-tolerant quantum hardware.\n",

    "Notable simulation algorithms, such as qubitization, quantum signal processing, or trotterization, can be used as subroutines in the quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm to obtain high-accuracy energy estimates of a targeted eigenstate. The Azure Quantum Resource Estimator is designed with these long-term algorithms (particularly QPE + qubitization) in mind (rather than VQE).\n",
