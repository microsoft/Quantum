# Getting started with Integrated Hybrid Computing

This sample illustrates how to blend classical and quantum instructions using a simple Q# program.

This sample is available in the notebook samples gallery in Azure Quantum workspaces in the Azure Portal. For an example of how to run these notebooks in Azure, see [this getting started guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/get-started-jupyter-notebook?tabs=tabid-ionq).
