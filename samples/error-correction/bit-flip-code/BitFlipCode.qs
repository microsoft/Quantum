    //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Introduction //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    // In this sample, we build on the discussion in the quantum error
    // correction section of the developers' guide:

    //     https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/user-guide/libraries/standard/error-correction

    // In particular, we start by manually encoding into the bit-flip code.
    // We then show how operations and functions provided in the Q# canon
    // allow us to easily model error correction in a way that immediately
    // generalizes to other codes.

    //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // The Bit-Flip Code /////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    // The bit-flip code protects against any one bit-flip (X) error on three
    // qubits by mapping |0〉 to |̅0〉 ≔ |000〉 and |1〉 to |̅1〉 ≔ |111〉. By
    // linearity, any other state |ψ〉 = α|0〉 + β|1〉 is represented by the
    // logical state

    //     |̅ψ〉 ≔ α |̅0〉 + β |̅1〉
    //         = α |000〉 + β |111〉.

    // We start by defining an operation which implements an encoder for
    // this code. To do so, note that CNOT allows us to "copy" classical
    // information in the bitstrings used to label computational basis
    // elements:

    //     CNOT |b0〉 = |bb〉,

    // where b ∈ {0, 1}. This is not the same as copying the state, since
    // CNOT acts linearly:

    //     CNOT (α |0〉 + β |1〉) ⊗ |0〉 = α |00〉 + β |11〉.

    // That is, consistent with the no-cloning theorem, CNOT did not
    // copy our arbitrary input state. On the other hand, this is
    // precisely the transformation that we want here:

    //    CNOT₀₂ · CNOT₀₁ (α |0〉 + β |1〉) ⊗ |00〉
    //        = α |000〉 + β |111〉
    //        = α |̅0〉 + β |̅1〉.

    // Thus, we can write out our encoder in a very simple form:

    /// # Summary
    /// Given a qubit representing a state to be protected and two auxiliary
    /// qubits initially in the |0〉 state, encodes the state into the
    /// three-qubit bit-flip code.
    ///
    /// # Input
    /// ## data
    /// A qubit whose state is to be protected.
    /// ## auxiliaryQubits
    /// Two qubits, initially in the |00〉 state, to be used in protecting
    /// the state of `data`.
    operation EncodeIntoBitFlipCode (data : Qubit, auxiliaryQubits : Qubit[]) : Unit
        // Since decoding is the adjoint of encoding, we must
        // denote that this operation supports the Adjoint
        // functor.
        is Adj + Ctl
    {
        // We use the ApplyToEach operation from the canon,
        // partially applied with the data qubit, to represent
        // a "CNOT-ladder." In this case, the line below
        // applies CNOT₀₁ · CNOT₀₂.
        ApplyToEachCA(CNOT(data, _), auxiliaryQubits);
    }

    // As a quick example, we will check that after encoding, the parity of
    // each pair of qubits is positive (corresponding to the Zero) Result,
    // such that we can learn syndrome information without revealing
    // the state of an encoded qubit.

    /// # Summary
    /// This operation encodes into a bit-flip code, and confirms that
    /// the parity measurements Z₀Z₁ and Z₁Z₂ both return positive eigenvalues
    /// (that is, the Result value Zero) without disturbing the state that
    /// we are trying to protect.
    ///
    /// # Remarks

    // Now that we have defined an operation which fails if the bit-flip
    // code fails to protect a state from a given error, we can call it
    // with the specific errors that the bit-flip code can correct.
    // To do so, it is helpful to use the ApplyPauli operation from

    //     ApplyPauli([PauliX, PauliI, PauliI], _)

    // is an operation of type (Qubit[] => ()) that represents
    // the X₀ bit-flip error.

    // Finally, we show how the logic described in this sample can be
    // generalized by using functionality from the canon. This will allow
    // us to consider much more involved error-correcting codes using the
    // same interface as the bit-flip code discussed here.
    // To underscore this point, we write our new operation to take a QECC
    // value as its input, where QECC is a type provided by the canon to
    // collect all of the relevant information about an error-correcting code.

    // The canon separates the role of the classical recovery process from
    // the rest of an error-correcting code, allowing for recovery functions
