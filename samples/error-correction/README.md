# Error Correction Samples

These samples show how to work with quantum error correcting codes in Q# programs.

- **[Bit-flip Code](./bit-flip-code)**:
  This sample describes a simple quantum code that encodes 1 qubit into 3 qubits and protects against a single bit-flip error.

- **[Syndrome](./syndrome)**:
  This sample implements a simple syndrome that can be used to detect errors in quantum algorithms executed on quantum hardware.
