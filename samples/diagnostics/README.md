# Diagnostics and Testing Samples

These samples show how to diagnose and test Q# applications.

- **[Dumping States and Operations](./dumping)**:
  This sample demonstrates how to dump useful diagnostics from the quantum simulator provided with the Quantum Development Kit, including states and unitary matrices.

- **[Using Facts and Assertions](./facts-and-assertions)**:
  This sample demonstrates how to use facts and assertions to check the correctness of quantum programs.

- **[Unit Testing](./unit-testing)**:
  This sample demonstrates how to use the unit testing functionality provided with the Quantum Development Kit to test the correctness of quantum programs.

- **[Visualizing Quantum Programs](./visualization)**:
  This sample demonstrates how to use the quantum program visualization tools provided with the Quantum Development Kit.
