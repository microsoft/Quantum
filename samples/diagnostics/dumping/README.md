# Dumping States and Operations in Q# Notebooks

This sample demonstrates:

- How to use quantum simulators to view the state of a quantum register.
- How to use quantum simulators to view unitary representations of adjointable operations.

In this sample, you can use Q# to dump useful diagnostics from the quantum simulator provided with the Quantum Development Kit, including states and unitary matrices.

## Prerequisites

- The Microsoft [Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/install-overview-qdk/).

## Running the Sample

This sample is designed to be run from Jupyter Notebook.
From the terminal, run the following command:

```Command Line
jupyter notebook
```

## Manifest

- [Dumping States and Operations.ipynb](https://github.com/microsoft/Quantum/blob/main/samples/diagnostics/dumping/Dumping%20States%20and%20Operations.ipynb): Main Q# notebook for this sample.

## Further resources

- [Use Q#: Test and debug](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/user-guide/testing-debugging#dump-functions)
