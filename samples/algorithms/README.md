# Algorithm Samples #

- **[Simple Grover](./simple-grover)**:
  This sample introduces Grover's algorithm for a simple hard-coded example.
- **[Database Search](./database-search/)**:
  This sample demonstrates how to use Grover's algorithm to efficiently search a database represented as a quantum register.
- **[Integer Factorization](./integer-factorization/)**:
  This sample demonstrates how to use Shor's algorithm to efficiently factor integers.
- **[Reversible Logic Synthesis](./reversible-logic-synthesis/)**:
  This sample demonstrates how to use reversible logic synthesis to solve the hidden shift problem.
- **[CHSH Game](./chsh-game/)**:
  This sample demonstrates a famous nonlocal game which proves that no theory of local hidden variables can ever reproduce all the predictions of quantum mechanics.
- **[Oracle Synthesis](./oracle-synthesis)**:
  This sample demonstrates how to build quantum oracles from reversible classical logic.
- **[Order Finding](./oracle-finding)**:
  This sample uses a quantum algorithm to find the order of a cycle in a permutation.
