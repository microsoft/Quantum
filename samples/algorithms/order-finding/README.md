# Order Finding

This sample uses a quantum algorithm to find the order of a cycle in a permutation.
It succeeds with a higher probability than the classical best possible strategy.
A challenge in the algorithm is to find a quantum circuit to realize the input permutation.
We utilize [reversible logic synthesis](../reversible-logic-synthesis) for this task.

The algorithm has been presented by L.M.K. Vandersypen, M. Steffen, G. Breyta, C.S. Yannoni, R. Cleve,
and I.L. Chuang in [Experimental realization of an order-finding algorithm with an NMR quantum computer](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.5452),
*Phys. Rev. Lett.* **85**, 5452, 2000.
The quantum algorithm in the Q# file is implemented for permutations over 2ⁿ elements, however, the classical post-processing
in the C# file is restricted to permutations over 4 elements.

## Running the Sample

To run the sample, use the `dotnet run --index VALUE` command from your terminal.
The value `VALUE` passed to the index argument must be between 0 and 3 inclusive.
