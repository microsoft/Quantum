# # Validating Quantum Mechanics with the CHSH Game

# This sample demonstrates:
# - How to prepare entangled states with Q#.
# - How to measure part of an entangled register.
# - Using Q# to understand superposition and entanglement.
#
# In this sample, you can use Q# to prepare qubits in an entangled state, and to check that measuring these qubits lets you win a game known as the _CHSH game_ more often than you can without entanglement.
# This game helps us understand entanglement, and has even been used experimentally to help test that the universe really is quantum mechanical in nature.
