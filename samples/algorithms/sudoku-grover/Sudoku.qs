    /// # Summary
    /// Solve a Sudoku puzzle using Grover's algorithm.
    ///
    /// # Description
    /// Sudoku is a graph coloring problem where graph edges must connect nodes 
    /// of different colors.
    /// In our case, graph nodes are puzzle squares and colors are the Sudoku numbers. 
    /// Graph edges are the constraints preventing squares from having the same values. 
    /// To reduce the number of qubits needed, we only use qubits for empty squares.
    /// We define the puzzle using 2 data structures:
    ///
    ///   - A list of edges connecting empty squares
    ///   - A list of constraints on empty squares to the initial numbers 
    ///     in the puzzle (starting numbers)
    /// The code works for both 9x9 Sudoku puzzles, and 4x4 Sudoku puzzles. 
    /// This description will use a 4x4 puzzle to make it easier to understand.
    /// The 4x4 puzzle is solved with number 0 to 3 instead of 1 to 4. 
    /// This is because we can encode 0-3 with 2 qubits.
    /// However, the same rules apply:
    ///    - The numbers 0 to 3 may only appear once per row, column and 2x2 sub squares.
    /// As an example              has solution
