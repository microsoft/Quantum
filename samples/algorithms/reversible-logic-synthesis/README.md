# Reversible Logic Synthesis

This sample demonstrates:

- How to use Q# to decompose permutations into quantum operations.
- How to apply decomposed permutations in algorithms such as hidden shift.

## Prerequisites

- The Microsoft [Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/install-overview-qdk/).

## Running the Sample

This sample can be run in a number of different ways, depending on your preferred environment.

### Python in Visual Studio Code or the Command Line

At a terminal, run the following command:

```powershell
python host.py
```

### Q# in Visual Studio Code or the Command Line

At a terminal, run the following command:

```powershell
dotnet run
```

### Q# in Visual Studio 2019

Open the folder containing this sample in Visual Studio ("Open a local folder"
from the Getting Started screen or "File → Open → Folder..." from the menu bar)
and set `ReversibleLogicSynthesis.csproj` as the startup project.
Press Start in Visual Studio to run the sample.
